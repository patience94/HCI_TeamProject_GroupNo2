### (1) Introduction: Background and goal of your research

### (2) Main contents

#### How to build your program

#### Necessary images (idea sketches, paper prototype, a screen capture of your program, …)

#### Explanation of source code if necessary (or just share the source code as a file)

#### Explanation of your program with images

#### Demo video

### (3) Conclusion

#### Limitations and future studies (for what you couldn’t finish in this project)

#### The conclusion paragraph of the document (including how the project was, what was difficult)
      Our project was expected to embody with leap motion. Firstly, we have realized the project skills with the keyboard and mouse. And then leap motion skills were required. However, because of technical and time constraints, we could not handle about this subjects. That is the biggest limitation of our project. 
       Also, there are some limitations from user test. Some contents are insufficient to play, such as constellations are too close together in constellation mode, so it makes hard to get signs of each regions. Besides, several users wanted to feel sound and diverse effects (ex. shining stars) for the young target users. 
       To commercialize our project, other languages are needed, and it would be nice to change the point of view, such as looking at the horizon when the user enters the spread mode.
        Furthermore, we are going to develop more skills. Diverse of stars and signs are supplemented as well as the interactions. We just made the scroll bar that makes user can show the seosonal changes and GPS settings. It would be great to implement them. Also, we think about voice annoucement services. 
        If we finally success the leap motion based project and supplement diverse skills, this software would be great educational program for young students and for whom are interested in constellation.
